tf.tidy

Create models that are tiny (maybe 64x64) for fast previewrendering. User can
choose between that and simpel spheres.

Don't draw spheres outside viewport. Would have a little time, perhaps.

Don't let protein get so close (increase that min distance). It doesn't look
good up close.

Put things in webworkers.

Click and drag on image to rotate? Would be great.

Ability to specify dimension size and model quality.

Description in .json file. Color scheme, etc.

Add hydrogens, swap in other atoms to make sure represented.

DONE
====

No offsets. This will futher encourage whole-protein visualizations.
